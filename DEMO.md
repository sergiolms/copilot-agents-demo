# Copilot Agents demo

## 1. Backend - Basic Server

```markdown
Create the backend entrypoint. The server should listen on port 3000 and expose a GET /api/health route that returns `{ ok: true }`.
```

## 2. Backend - CRUD with Prompt File

```markdown
/crud Generate a Todo entity (id, title, done).
```

## 3. Chat Mode - Project Manager

- Set chat mode to `project-manager`
- Write the following:

```markdown
We want to add authentication. Define the scope, acceptance criteria, risks and roadmap.
```

## 4. Frontend - TODO UI

```markdown
Create a simple React Todo List app that uses the backend endpoints. It should list items, allow adding new ones, and toggling completion.
```

## 5. Refinement

```markdown
Let's polish the UI. Use Tailwind to create a spooky halloween theme for the TODO app. Add a random time event where a spiderweb emoji appears fixed on top, and a spider emoji drops leaving a line as if it was a webshot. Make sure all the text in the theme has the correct contrast. 
```

```markdown
Add input validation using Zod.
```

```markdown
Add a soft delete flag to the Todo CRUD endpoints.
```
