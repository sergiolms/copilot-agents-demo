# AGENTS.md â€” Global Agent Rules

This repo contains a backend (Node + TS + Express) and a frontend (React + Vite + TS).

## Global Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript everywhere.
- Add tests for every new feature.
- Follow KISS principles and clean architecture.
- All API routes must be prefixed with `/api`.
