# TODO-01 Authentication Foundation

## Description (Jira Style)

As a developer, I need a foundational authentication layer so that future user-related features (registration, login, authorization, password reset, token refresh) can be implemented consistently and securely.

## Scope

- Introduce `User` conceptual model (no persistent DB yet; abstraction layer to allow later DB integration).
- Password hashing strategy defined (bcrypt or argon2 decision recorded â€” default: bcrypt with cost factor 12).
- Environment-based configuration (JWT secrets, token lifetimes) centralized.
- Basic security utilities (hash, compare, generate tokens, validate tokens).
- No endpoints yet (handled in later tasks).

## Out of Scope

- Actual registration or login endpoints.
- Refresh token rotation logic.
- Password reset logic.
- Frontend changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given the codebase is built, When the auth utils are imported, Then a function exists to hash and verify passwords.
Given a payload with a user id, When an access token is generated, Then it encodes the user id and expires according to configuration.
Given an invalid or tampered JWT, When validation is attempted, Then validation fails with an error result (not thrown unhandled).
Given configuration values are missing, When the server starts, Then a clear error message indicates which variable is absent.

## Gherkin Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Hashing a password
  Given a plain text password "Secret123!" 
  When I call the hash function
  Then I receive a non-empty hashed string different from the plain password

Scenario: Verifying a correct password
  Given a plain password "Secret123!" and its stored hash
  When I verify the password
  Then the result is true

Scenario: Verifying an incorrect password
  Given a stored hash for password "Secret123!" and an attempted password "Wrong!"
  When I verify the password
  Then the result is false

Scenario: Generating an access token
  Given a user id "user-123"
  When I generate an access token
  Then the token decodes to include the user id and an expiry claim

Scenario: Validating a tampered token
  Given a valid token that is modified afterwards
  When I attempt validation
  Then validation fails

Scenario: Missing configuration variable
  Given the JWT secret env var is unset
  When the app initializes auth config
  Then an initialization error is raised identifying the missing variable
```

## Risks

- Weak hashing parameters could enable brute force (mitigate via cost factor review).
- Inconsistent token claims cause downstream auth failures.
- Secrets mishandled (ensure .env pattern later and no logging of secrets).
- Premature optimization before persistence is chosen.

## Mitigations

- Document chosen algorithms & parameters in file header.
- Provide a single config module enforcing presence and types.
- Add unit tests for each utility function now to prevent regression.

## Roadmap Steps

1. Define auth config module (loads env or defaults + validation).
2. Implement password hashing & comparison util.
3. Implement JWT sign & verify util (access + placeholder for refresh structure).
4. Create user model interface + repository abstraction (in-memory placeholder array/Map).
5. Add unit tests (hash/compare, sign/verify, config validation, repository basic CRUD for user model).
6. Documentation block summarizing security decisions.

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria scenarios have corresponding automated unit tests.
- CI tests pass (no unhandled promise rejections in auth code path).
- No secrets printed to console in normal operation.
- Module exported but not yet wired into endpoints.

## Linked tasks

- TODO-02_user-registration (depends on foundation)
- TODO-03_login-and-session-management (depends on foundation)
- TODO-06_token-refresh-and-revocation (depends on foundation)
